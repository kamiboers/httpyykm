####HTTP, Yeah You Know Me
#####Description:
This project is a learning exercise requiring us to build a local server capable of receiving HTTP requests, parsing and interpreting these requests, and sending the appropriate HTML response to the request. 

git clone https://github.com:kamiboers/httpyykm.git
cd httpyykm

To utilize this application, clone down the repository using the above code and open server.rb in the command line.
